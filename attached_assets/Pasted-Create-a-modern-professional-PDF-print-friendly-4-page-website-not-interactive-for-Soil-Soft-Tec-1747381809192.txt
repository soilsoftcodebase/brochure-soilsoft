Create a modern, professional, PDF-print-friendly 4-page website (not interactive) for Soil Soft Technologies Pvt. Ltd., a fast-growing tech startup based in Ponnur, Andhra Pradesh, India. This is for an investment presentation, so design must be clean, colorful, and impressive like a startup pitch deck.

🖋️ Use minimal text, infographics, icons, and visuals (timelines, roadmap, bar graphs).

🎨 Colors:

Background: White

Primary: Navy Blue (#0A2342)

Accent: Forest Green (#2E8B57)

Support: Sky Blue (#A6E3E9), Soft Grey (#F5F5F5)

Fonts: Poppins / Inter / Montserrat

🚫 Avoid interactive buttons (no “click here” or “try now”) – must be printable as PDF.

👨‍💼 Target Audience: An MP & Investor with multiple companies – this should reflect innovation, impact, and growth potential.
